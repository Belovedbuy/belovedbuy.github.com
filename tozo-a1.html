    <h2>Why the TOZO A1 Stands Out</h2>

    <h3>Bluetooth 5.3 Connectivity</h3>
    <p>Experience faster pairing and rock-solid signal up to 33 ft away—no more dropouts during your commute or workouts.</p>

    <h3>Ultra-Light Comfort</h3>
    <p>At under 4g per earbud, these pods disappear in your ears, perfect for long listening sessions without fatigue.</p>

    <h3>IPX5 Waterproof</h3>
    <p>Rain or sweat won’t slow you down. Jog, gym, or even light drizzle—your music stays on.</p>

    <h3>Crystal-Clear Calls</h3>
    <p>Dual MEMS microphones and AI noise reduction filter out background noise, so every word comes through loud and clear.</p>

    <h3>Personalized Sound</h3>
    <p>32 EQ presets via the TOZO app let you dial in the perfect bass, mids, or treble. Gaming? Podcasts? EDM? You control the vibe.</p>
